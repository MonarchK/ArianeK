            <p>As a self-employed fashion stylist and photographer,
             I combine my creative skills and business acumen to create stunning and engaging visual content for various clients and platforms.
              I have been working in this field for over a year and a half, and I have developed a diverse portfolio of projects,
               ranging from editorial shoots to personal branding campaigns. I have also gained proficiency in multiple foreign languages,
                which enables me to communicate effectively with different audiences and cultures. 
                Additionally, I have strong people management skills, as I often collaborate with models, designers, makeup artists, 
                and other professionals in the fashion industry. Alongside my freelance work, 
                I am pursuing a Bachelor of Laws degree at Queen Mary University of London, 
                where I am learning about the legal aspects of various fields, including fashion, media, and intellectual property. 
                I am passionate about fashion and I wish to write my own visual stories about it.
